        <p>On the first day of University, in my first class, I will never forget what my visual arts professor said to us (well I don’t remember the exact wording but paraphrasing): 

“I once missed class because I saw a tree I just had to climb. If you find your tree, it’s ok if you miss class…”

Ever since then I’ve been searching for that tree. This has been my journey. Walking through a forest of endless possibilities, to learn and grow, through school, work, and experiences. </p>
