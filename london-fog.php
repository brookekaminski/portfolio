                <p>This was a project we were basically given free range on, the only requirement was that it was a one page responsive website. Because we had just learned to use media queries, not only did I want to provide a fluid experience so users could view the website comfortably on any device but I wanted to provide unique experiences. I found a way to connect a desktop, tablet, and phone view but had them all slightly different in case my user cam back to the site on a different device, maybe as a bit of an easter egg. And I wanted to further explore media queries by having things change rather than just resize on different screens. The posts turn from a masonry style to a interlocking grid when switched to mobile for example.</p>
